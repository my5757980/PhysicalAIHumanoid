# Research Notes: Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

## Decision: Textbook Format and Structure
**Rationale**: The textbook will be structured as Markdown files compatible with the Docusaurus documentation system, allowing for easy web-based access and navigation. This format supports both technical content and educational features like collapsible sections, code blocks, and cross-references.

**Alternatives considered**:
- PDF format: Less interactive and harder to update
- Interactive web application: More complex to develop and maintain
- Static HTML: Less maintainable than Markdown-based system

## Decision: Content Organization
**Rationale**: The content is organized into 4 main chapters with multiple sections each, following a logical progression from fundamentals to specialized topics. Each chapter includes learning objectives and summaries to support educational goals.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Single monolithic document: Harder to navigate and maintain
- More granular sections: Could fragment the learning experience
- Different chapter order: Current order provides proper foundational knowledge

## Decision: Technical Depth Balance
**Rationale**: Content maintains technical accuracy while remaining accessible to engineering students. Complex concepts are explained with practical examples and real-world applications.

**Alternatives considered**:
- More simplified content: Would not meet technical education requirements
- More advanced content: Would be too challenging for target audience
- Academic paper style: Would be less accessible and practical

## Decision: Real-world Examples Integration
**Rationale**: Including examples from Boston Dynamics Atlas, Agility Robotics Digit, and Tesla Optimus provides concrete applications that help students understand abstract concepts.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Theoretical examples only: Less engaging and practical
- Different robot examples: Selected examples represent state-of-the-art in humanoid robotics
- No examples: Would make content too abstract
