# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Native Textbook

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**. This AI-native textbook covers the fundamental concepts of embodied intelligence and humanoid robotics, from basic principles to advanced applications.

## About This Textbook

This textbook provides a thorough exploration of Physical AI - an emerging field that combines artificial intelligence with physical systems to create machines that can perceive, reason, and act in the real world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate primarily in digital spaces, Physical AI systems are embodied, meaning they have physical form and interact with their environment through sensors and actuators.

## Chapters

The textbook is organized into four comprehensive chapters:

### [Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics](./chapter-1/index.md)
- Understanding Physical AI and its distinction from traditional AI
- Exploring humanoid robot design and capabilities
- Core components: embodiment, perception, learning, and control
- Interdisciplinary foundations and real-world examples

### [Chapter 2: Foundations of Robotics & Mechatronics](./chapter-2/index.md)
- Kinematics, dynamics, and degrees of freedom
- Sensors and actuators for robotic systems
- Motor control, torque, and balance principles
- Materials, structural design, and mechatronic integration

### [Chapter 3: AI for Embodied Intelligence](./chapter-3/index.md)
- Computer vision, SLAM, and perception stacks
- Reinforcement learning for control systems
- Imitation learning and teleoperation techniques
- Decision making, planning, and multimodal models

### [Chapter 4: Humanoid Locomotion, Manipulation & Autonomy](./chapter-4/index.md)
- Bipedal walking and stability control
- Grippers, hands, and dexterous manipulation
- Whole-body motion control strategies
- Human-robot interaction and autonomous task execution

## Learning Objectives

Each chapter includes:
- Clear learning objectives
- Comprehensive content with technical depth
