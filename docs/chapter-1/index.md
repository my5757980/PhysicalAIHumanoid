# Chapter 1: Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Overview

Physical AI represents a paradigm shift in artificial intelligence, where intelligence is not just computational but embodied in physical systems that interact with the real world. This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and humanoid robotics, exploring how these technologies are converging to create more capable and intuitive robotic systems. We'll examine the interdisciplinary nature of this field and look at real-world examples that demonstrate the potential of embodied intelligence.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Define Physical AI and explain how it differs from traditional AI approaches
- Identify the advantages and challenges of humanoid robot design
- Recognize the key components of Physical AI systems: embodiment, perception, learning, and control
