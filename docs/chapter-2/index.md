# Chapter 2: Foundations of Robotics & Mechatronics

## Overview

This chapter provides the fundamental technical foundations necessary for understanding and building robotic systems. We'll explore the core principles of robotics including kinematics and dynamics that govern robot motion, the sensors and actuators that enable environmental interaction, and the mechatronic integration that brings these components together. Understanding these foundations is crucial for developing effective Physical AI systems, as they provide the physical substrate upon which intelligent behavior is built.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you should be able to:
- Understand the mathematical foundations of robot kinematics and dynamics
- Identify the types and functions of sensors and actuators in robotic systems
- Explain the principles of motor control, torque generation, and balance maintenance
- Recognize the importance of materials selection and structural design in robotics
- Analyze the challenges and approaches in mechatronic integration

## Summary

This chapter established the technical foundations of robotics and mechatronics that underpin Physical AI systems. We explored the mathematical principles of kinematics and dynamics that govern robot motion, examined the sensors and actuators that enable environmental interaction, and discussed the control strategies needed for motor control and balance. The importance of materials and structural design was highlighted, along with the challenges of mechatronic integration. These foundations provide the physical basis for the intelligent behaviors that will be explored in subsequent chapters.
