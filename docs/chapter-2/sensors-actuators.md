# Sensors & Actuators

## Overview

Sensors are the eyes, ears, and skin of robotic systems, providing information about the robot's state and its environment. Proprioceptive sensors measure internal state variables like joint angles, velocities, and torques, while exteroceptive sensors provide information about the external environment. Common proprioceptive sensors include encoders for measuring joint angles, inertial measurement units (IMUs) for orientation and acceleration, and force/torque sensors for measuring interaction forces.

## Vision and Range Sensors

Vision sensors like cameras provide rich information about the environment but require significant computational resources to process. Depth sensors, LiDAR, and other range-finding devices provide geometric information about the environment. Tactile sensors on robot hands and feet enable fine manipulation and stable locomotion by providing information about contact forces and surface properties.

## Actuators

Actuators are the muscles of robotic systems, converting energy into mechanical motion. Electric motors are the most common actuators in robotics, with servo motors providing precise position control and brushless DC motors offering high efficiency and power density. For humanoid robots, actuators must provide sufficient torque and speed while maintaining compact size and low weight.

## Actuator Types and Selection

The choice of actuators significantly impacts robot performance. Series elastic actuators provide compliance that can improve safety and energy efficiency, while variable stiffness actuators can adapt their mechanical properties to different tasks. Hydraulic and pneumatic actuators offer high power-to-weight ratios but can be complex and require external power sources.
