# Autonomous Task Execution

## Overview

Autonomous task execution involves the integration of perception, planning, learning, and control to achieve complex goals without human intervention. For humanoid robots, this means performing tasks that typically require human-level capabilities in perception, manipulation, and decision-making. The challenge is to create systems that can handle the uncertainty and variability of real-world environments.

## Task Planning

Task planning for humanoid robots must consider both high-level task structure and low-level physical constraints. This includes sequencing actions, allocating resources, and handling contingencies. The planning system must also account for the robot's physical capabilities and limitations, ensuring that planned actions are feasible and safe.

## Execution Monitoring and Recovery

Execution monitoring and recovery are crucial for autonomous task execution, as plans may fail due to unexpected conditions or modeling errors. The robot must detect failures, diagnose the cause, and replan or recover appropriately. This requires sophisticated monitoring systems and recovery strategies that can handle various types of failures.

## Long-term Autonomy

Long-term autonomy involves maintaining performance over extended periods, including handling wear and degradation, adapting to changing environments, and learning from experience to improve performance. This requires systems that can detect and compensate for component degradation, update environment models, and continuously refine their capabilities based on experience.
