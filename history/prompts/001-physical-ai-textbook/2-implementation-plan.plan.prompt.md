## Prompt

Create a detailed project plan for my "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — AI-Native Textbook" project. Include the next actionable steps, tasks to complete, dependencies between tasks, priorities, and suggested deadlines. Focus on reviewing and finalizing each chapter, integrating AI examples, adding diagrams if needed, editing for clarity, and preparing the textbook for publication.

## Response snapshot

Created comprehensive implementation plan for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with technical context, research findings, data model, quickstart guide, and content specification contract. The plan includes all required artifacts for textbook development with proper structure and validation rules.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and contracts/
- 🔁 Next prompts: Proceed to task creation with /sp.tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan addresses all aspects of textbook development with proper structure
