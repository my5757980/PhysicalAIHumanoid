## Response snapshot

Successfully updated the tasks file in specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md by appending the RAG chatbot integration tasks as requested. The new tasks follow the required checklist format with proper task IDs (T085-T113), file paths, and parallelization markers where appropriate. Tasks are organized into 5 main categories: Backend Setup, Document Ingestion Pipeline, Frontend Chat Widget, RAG Logic, and QA & Debugging.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Tasks file updated with RAG chatbot integration tasks
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: specs/001-physical-ai-textbook/tasks.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: none
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks were properly formatted according to the required checklist format with IDs and file paths

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Script .specify/scripts/bash/create-phr.sh does not exist, had to manually create PHR file using template
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): N/A
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Update documentation to include PowerShell script path if that's the intended approach on Windows
