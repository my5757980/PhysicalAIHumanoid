## Prompt

Setup the complete project structure for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook implementation, including spec, plan, tasks, research, and quickstart documents, and update the tasks file to reflect completed work.

## Response snapshot

Completed the full project setup for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook with all required documentation: specification, implementation plan, tasks list, research notes, and quick start guide. The constitution was already created with all 4 chapters. All project artifacts are properly structured and documented with PHRs.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete project structure established for textbook implementation
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created/updated 6 documentation files and 1 PHR
- 🔁 Next prompts: Chapter content review and technical accuracy verification
- 🧠 Reflection: Project foundation is complete with proper documentation structure

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
